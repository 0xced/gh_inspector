module Inspector

  # To get started using The Issues Inspector, you will need to
  # create an inspector. This class is main public API for querying issues.
  #
  # #### Getting started
  #
  # Create an instance of `Inspector::Inspector`, you can then ask it to search
  # based on your raised exception, or as a direct query yourself.
  #
  # ``` ruby
  # require 'gh-issues-inspector'
  # inspector = Inspector::Inspector("orta", "eigen")
  # inspector.search_query "Someone set us up the bomb"
  # ```
  #
  # By default this would output:
  #
  # ```
